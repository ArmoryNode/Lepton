# Lepton [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/o5k9dioc2r5hmyr3?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/DaemonErrors/lepton)

A Carbon 2185 companion application for creating/maintaining character sheets, built on top of Blazor Webassembly, ASP.Net Core and Azure Table Storage.

No clear plan for it yet, just a small project for now.
